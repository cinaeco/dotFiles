# The order in, and conditions of, which `zsh` config files are sourced:
#
# .zshenv: (always)
# .zprofile: [[ -o login ]]
# .zshrc: [[ -o interactive ]]
# .zlogin: [[ -o login ]]
#
# As seen, `zshenv` is sourced on all invocations of the shell. It is useful for
# setting variables that should be available to other programs e.g. `PATH`,
# `EDITOR`, `PAGER`, and generally not the place to put commands that produce
# output or assume attachment to a tty/terminal.

export EDITOR='vim'

# Paths
export PATH=$HOME/dotfiles/bin:$PATH
export PATH=$HOME/.rvm/bin:$PATH
