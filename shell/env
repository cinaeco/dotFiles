# M = verbose `less` prompt

# Config Files: Which Are Sourced, And When?
#
# # BASH
#
# .bash_profile: interactive login
# .bash_login: as above but lower preference
# .profile: as above but lower preference
# .bashrc: interactive non-login
#
# Interactive = not a script.
# Login = shell that starts with a computer, or connection from tty or ssh.
# Non-login = shell that starts from a terminal emulator or GUI.
# So, put things mostly in `.bashrc`, source from `.bash_profile`.
#
# # ZSH
#
# .zshenv: (always)
# .zprofile: [[ -o login ]]
# .zshrc: [[ -o interactive ]]
# .zlogin: [[ -o login ]]
#
# As seen, `zshenv` is sourced on all invocations of zsh. It is useful for
# setting variables that should be available to other programs e.g. `PATH`,
# `EDITOR`, `PAGER`, and generally not the place to put commands that produce
# output or assume attachment to a tty/terminal.
