# vim: ft=tmux
# Settings for tmux pre-2.1

# Mouse Support! (for scrollback, and lazy manipulation of windows/panes)
# At least with iTerm2, this plays very well with vim mouse support :D Yay!
# Note: text-selection by default does a tmux copy (paste with prefix+]).
# Hold alt/meta/option for system selection/copy.
